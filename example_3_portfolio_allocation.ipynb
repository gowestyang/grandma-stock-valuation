    "The idea is to allocate more to more under-valued instruments, and less to more more-valued instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The math behind is in two simple steps - you can do it in an excel. Let me explain with an example:\n",
    "* Say, there are 3 instruments (`A`, `B`, `C`) in your portfolio, and they are valuated (by years) at:\n",
    "    * `A = 0.5, B = 0, C = -0.5` (A is over-valued and C is under-valued)\n",
    "    * The first step is to covert the valuations to **positive valuation scores**. One way is to use an **exponential function**.\n",
    "        * `s(A) = exp(-s * A) = exp(-1 * 0.5) = 0.607`\n",
    "        * `s(B) = exp(-s * B) = exp(-1 * 0) = 1.0`\n",
    "        * `s(C) = exp(-s * C) = exp(-1 * -0.5) = 1.649`\n",
    "        * `s` in the equations is the **scale**. We use 1 for now, and I will explain it later.\n",
    "    * The last step is to get allocation % by distributing the valuation scores:\n",
    "        * `v(A) = s(A)/(s(A) + s(B) + s(C)) = 0.607 / (0.607 + 1.0 + 1.649) = 18.6%`\n",
    "        * `v(B) = s(B)/(s(A) + s(B) + s(C)) = 1 / (0.607 + 1.0 + 1.649) = 30.7%`\n",
    "        * `v(C) = s(C)/(s(A) + s(B) + s(C)) = 1.649 / (0.607 + 1.0 + 1.649) = 50.6%`\n",
    "* That's it! The most over-valued instrument `A` got the lowest allocation (18.6%), and the most under-valued instrument `C` got the highest allocation (50.6%).\n",
    "    * Now let's exam the effect of scale `s`. We use `s = 2` to calculate the allocation again:\n",
    "        * `s(A) = exp(-s * A) = exp(-2 * 0.5) = 0.368`\n",
    "        * `s(B) = exp(-s * B) = exp(-2 * 0) = 1.0`\n",
    "        * `s(C) = exp(-s * C) = exp(-2 * -0.5) = 2.718`\n",
    "        * `v(A) = s(A)/(s(A) + s(B) + s(C)) = 0.368 / (0.368 + 1.0 + 2.718) = 9.0%`\n",
    "        * `v(B) = s(B)/(s(A) + s(B) + s(C)) = 1 / (0.368 + 1.0 + 2.718) = 24.5%`\n",
    "        * `v(C) = s(C)/(s(A) + s(B) + s(C)) = 2.718 / (0.368 + 1.0 + 2.718) = 66.5%`\n",
    "* As you see, with larger scale `s`, the allocator is more sensitive to valuation - more % goes to under-valued instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulation above is called `softmax` function, which is widely used in machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection of parameters:\n",
    "* In the first step, besides using **exponential function** to convert valuations to positive score, there are also other functions to achive the purpose. `Grandma` also provides you the **sigmoid function** - you can try it out yourself later.\n",
    "    * Exponential function is used by default. This function will significantly (exponentially) allocate to very-under-valued instruments, while it does not give strong punishment to just-over-valued instruments.\n",
    "    * Sigmoid function applied a cap on both sides. As the valuation of an instrument keeps on going more under-valued (or over-valued), at some stage, the allocation will get little change.\n",
    "* For the **scale**, you can just use `scale=1` if there is no specific reason.\n",
    "    * If no scale is provided, `Grandma` will use `scale = 2 - 2/n`, where `n` is the number of **non-cash** instruments in your portfolio. This yields larger scale for more instruments in your portfolio.\n",
    "        * The purpose is to **keep your portfolio managable**. As an individual, it is hard to manage a portofilo with more than 10 stocks (and it is unnecessary). With larger scale, the allocator trend to reduce allocation to very-over-valued stocks towards 0%, thus help you to focus on a small, managable number of stocks."
